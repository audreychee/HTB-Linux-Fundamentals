Part 2: The Shell
1. Prompt Description
What is the Bash Prompt?
The Bash prompt is a line of text shown when the shell is ready to accept commands.

It typically shows:

Username – who you are.

Hostname – name of the computer.

Current Directory – where you are.

Appears like:

php-template
Copy
Edit
<username>@<hostname><current working directory>$
The home directory is shown as ~.

php-template
Copy
Edit
<username>@<hostname>[~]$
Prompt symbol meanings:

$ → normal (unprivileged) user.

# → root (privileged) user.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
root@htb[/htb]#
If the PS1 variable is not set, minimal prompts may show:

ruby
Copy
Edit
$   ← unprivileged
#   ← privileged
Customizing the Prompt (PS1 Variable)
PS1 controls the format of the Bash prompt.

You can include:

Username, hostname, current directory

Colors, date/time, last command status, IP address, etc.

Useful for penetration testers and admins for visibility and tracking.

Example: Show full path instead of just current folder name.
